THe next things that i have to figure out in the morning are until project completion. 

** the RSVP Option needs a Function in user that stores first and last names**

** THe RSVP option also somehow needs to store those people in a seprate vector or Set list to display with each event somehow reference one to another idk **

** I need to redo the Interface and make it more clear that the user is inputing the day and month , and also some hwo make the interface more appealing ** 

** finally the user Interface needs polish and to check that all questions have been answered so that this project is a success, and then test **
